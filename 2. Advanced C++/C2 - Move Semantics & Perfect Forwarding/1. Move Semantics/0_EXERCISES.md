Some exercises:

1. Simple Move: Create a class with a move constructor and move assignment operator. Use it to move an object from one variable to another and verify that the move constructor is called and the original variable is left in a valid but unspecified state.

2. Vector Move: Create a vector of objects with a move constructor and move assignment operator. Use it to move elements from one index to another and verify that the move constructor is called and the original element is left in a valid but unspecified state.

3. Copy vs Move: Create a program that copies and moves objects of different sizes and measures the time it takes. Compare the performance of copying and moving for different types of objects and sizes.
