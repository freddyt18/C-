Some exercises:

1. Simple Move: Create a class with a move constructor and move assignment operator. Use it to move an object from one variable to another and verify that the move constructor is called and the original variable is left in a valid but unspecified state.

2. Vector Move: Create a vector of objects with a move constructor and move assignment operator. Use it to move elements from one index to another and verify that the move constructor is called and the original element is left in a valid but unspecified state.

3. Function Move: Create a function that takes a move-only object as a parameter and returns a moved object. Use it to move an object and verify that the move constructor is called and the original object is left in a valid but unspecified state.

4. Custom Type Move: Create a custom class with a move constructor and move assignment operator that uses a resource (e.g. a dynamic memory allocation). Use it to move an object and verify that the resource is properly transferred and the original object is left in a valid but unspecified state.

5. Copy vs Move: Create a program that copies and moves objects of different sizes and measures the time it takes. Compare the performance of copying and moving for different types of objects and sizes.
