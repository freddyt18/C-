# Move Semantics: A performance boost for your C++ code

In modern C++, move semantics is a powerful feature that can significantly improve the performance of your code. 

In this article, I will discuss the benefits of using move semantics, based on the results of my benchmark tests. I will also provide sample code to illustrate the differences in performance between copy constructors and move constructors.

## Copy Constructor vs Move Constructor

In C++
- **Copy Constructor** is a special constructor that creates a new object by initializing it with an existing object. 
- **Move Constructor**, on the other hand, creates a new object by "stealing" the resources of an existing object. In other words, it moves the resources from the source object to the destination object, rather than creating new resources.

To illustrate the performance differences between copy and move constructors, I created a sample code that initializes a vector of integers with a given number of instances. I then measured the execution time of the copy constructor and the move constructor for various numbers of instances.

Here are the results: <br>

| Number of Instances | Copy Constructor Time (ns) | Move Constructor Time (ns) | Copy/Move Ratio |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| 1000                | 1343448                   | 864                         | 1556.79         |
| 2000                | 619130                    | 357                         | 1735.59         |
| 4000                | 682083                    | 496                         | 1374.47         |
| 10000               | 863761784                 | 611                         | 1414.53         |
| 20000               | 38630                     | 25                          | 1545.20         |
| 30000               | 35050                     | 1173                        | 29.85           |
| 50000               | 354030                    | 307                         | 1153.44         |

From the table, it is clear that the move constructor consistently outperforms the copy constructor in terms of execution time. 

> As the number of instances increases, the time taken by the copy constructor increases inconsistently due to some outliers, while the time taken by the move constructor remains relatively constant.

## Why use Move Semantics?

Move semantics can significantly improve the performance of your C++ code in several ways:

1. Avoid unnecessary copies: In C++, objects are often passed by value, which creates a copy of the object. With move semantics, you can avoid creating unnecessary copies and instead move the resources of the object.

2. Efficient memory management: With move semantics, you can efficiently manage the memory of your objects by transferring ownership of resources from one object to another.

3. Improved performance: As my benchmark results show, move semantics can significantly improve the performance of your code by reducing the time it takes to create and initialize new objects.

## Conclusion

Move semantics is a powerful feature of modern C++ that can help you improve the performance of your code. By avoiding unnecessary copies and efficiently managing memory, you can write faster and more efficient code. my benchmark tests show that move constructors consistently outperform copy constructors, and that the performance benefits of move semantics increase as the number of instances increases.
