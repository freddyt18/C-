Type casting and type conversion are important concepts in C++ programming that allow you to change the data type of a variable. 
- Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another, while type conversion is the process of converting one data type into another implicitly or explicitly.

There are two types of type casting in C++: implicit and explicit. 
- Implicit type casting is done automatically by the compiler.
- Explicit type casting is done manually by the programmer using special syntax.

In C++, there are several types of type conversions:

1. Implicit Type Conversion:
Implicit type conversion is performed automatically by the compiler when it is safe to do so. For example, when you assign a smaller value to a larger variable, the compiler automatically converts the smaller value to the larger type.

```
int x = 10;
double y = x; //implicit type conversion from int to double
```

2. Explicit Type Conversion:
Explicit type conversion is performed manually by the programmer using the casting operator. The syntax for explicit type conversion is as follows:

```
(static_cast<new_type>(expression))
```

For example, to convert a double to an integer, you can use the static_cast operator as follows:

```
double x = 3.14159;
int y = static_cast<int>(x);
```

3. C-style Type Conversion:
C-style type conversion is an older form of type conversion that is not recommended in modern C++ programming. It is performed using the following syntax:

```
(new_type) expression
```

For example:

```
double x = 3.14159;
int y = (int) x;
```

4. Type Conversion Functions:
Type conversion functions are special functions that allow you to convert one data type into another. The most common type conversion functions in C++ are atoi(), atof(), and strtol().

- atoi() is used to convert a string into an integer
- atof() is used to convert a string into a floating-point number
- strtol() is used to convert a string into a long integer

```
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string str = "1234";
    int num = atoi(str.c_str());
    cout << num << endl; // output: 1234
    return 0;
}
```

It is important to note that type conversion can lead to data loss or unexpected results if not done carefully. It is always a good practice to check the validity of data before performing type conversion.
