1. Basic C++
    - ~~Basic syntax and language elements, such as variables, data types, and operators.~~
    - ~~Control statements, such as conditional statements (if-else statements) and loops (for, while, do-while loops).~~
    - ~~Functions, including defining, calling, and passing arguments.~~
    - ~~Arrays, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation.~~
    - ~~Classes and objects, including constructors, destructors, and encapsulation.~~
    - ~~Inheritance, polymorphism, and virtual functions.~~
    - ~~Input and output, including standard input/output streams, file handling, and formatted output.~~
    - ~~Templates and generic programming.~~
    - ~~Standard Template Library (STL), including containers, iterators, and algorithms.~~
    - ~~Exception handling, error handling, and debugging techniques.~~
    - ~~Multi-threading and concurrent programming.~~
    - ~~Preprocessor directives and macros.~~
    - ~~Namespaces and scope.~~
    - ~~Type casting and type conversion.~~
    - ~~Standard C++ library functions and data structures.~~


2. Advanced C++
    - ~~Smart pointers and memory management techniques.~~
    - Move semantics and perfect forwarding.
    - Type traits and static reflection.
    - Template metaprogramming and constexpr functions.
    - Design patterns, such as singleton, factory, observer, and visitor.
    - Advanced object-oriented programming concepts, such as multiple inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces.
    - Operator overloading and advanced operator techniques.
    - The C++ Standard Library advanced topics, such as concurrency and networking.
    - Functional programming techniques in C++, including lambdas, closures, and functional objects.
    - Advanced debugging techniques, including using debuggers and profiling tools.
    - Advanced compiler optimization techniques.
    - Modern C++ features, such as concepts, modules, and coroutines.
    - High-performance computing techniques, such as parallel programming and SIMD instructions.

3. C++ for Gaming Development
    - Graphics programming with OpenGL or DirectX, including shaders, textures, and 3D models.
    - Game engine architecture, including scene graph management, event systems, and game state management.
    - Collision detection and physics simulations, including rigid body dynamics and particle systems.
    - Artificial intelligence techniques, such as pathfinding and behavior trees.
    - Networking and multiplayer game development.
    - Sound and audio programming, including audio synthesis and mixing.
    - Performance optimization techniques for game development, such as caching and data locality.
    - Game scripting with Lua or other scripting languages.
    - Cross-platform development techniques, including platform-specific APIs and tools.
    - Design patterns for game development, such as the entity-component-system architecture.
